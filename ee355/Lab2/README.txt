This is a README for lab2 for EE355 Spring2019

The first part of the script, namely lines 1-6 were purely initializing variables i needed and opening the input file to be used later.

Lines 7-13 are adding the values from the input.txt to the matrices A and B. This is done by assuming the matrices will ALWAYS be 8 x 8. 

Lines 15-18, because of how i wrote the data into the matrices, the data was str type and needed to be converted to int to be used for matrix multiplication later on.

lines 21,22 are the code to start a timer to time the matrix multiplication

lines 24-27 is the Naive Matrix multiplcation algorithm 

lines 29,30 are the code to end the timer and calculate total time taken

lines 31-39 are the ending lines of code to write my outputs of matrix multiplication and time of matrix multiplication into their respective output files.
